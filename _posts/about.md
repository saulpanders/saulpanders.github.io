## Who Am I?
Hi there! \
\
I'm @saulpanders, nice to meet you. I have a wide range of interests and enjoy sharing these passions with other like-minded individuals. Some of the hats I like to wear include: Artist, musician, writer, hacker, computer scientist, cryptographer, amateur mathematician, and security consultant. \
\
If you like what you see, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message. I <i>will </i> get to you when I can. \
Thanks for stopping by!

## What is this Blog?
For as long as I can remember, I've always had a hard time finishing projects. Call it whatever you will: a lack of solid attention span, the fact that there are only 24 hours in a day, or some third thing. \
\
The point is, starting a project is easy - finishing one is another story entirely. Recently, I recognized that an essential reason why many of my endeavors end up half-finished was that I lacked accountability. Your job as a reader is to be the faceless audience whom I hope to entertain, and not disappoint. \
\
From artistic expression to technical deep dives, this blog represents the amalgamation of all my various hobbies and skills. Hopefully you can expect to see all kinds of content shared here. I will attempt to hold myself to a standard of "at least one post per month", but may adjust that schedule depending on its feasibility. \
\
If you spot errors please pm me and I'll fix. Any views expressed here are entirely my own unless cited otherwise.

## And the Name?
The name "Yet Another Blog" is kind of a "tongue-in-cheek" way to poke fun at the fact that there are an uncountable number of blogs like this one all across the internet. What makes this one special is that its mine :)
